# Crowdsourced-Mapping-Analysis
<li> Performed Extensive Data Analysis on the Dataset by Using Supervised and Unsupervised techniques. </li>
<li> Initially Classification models were built with various Algorithms, each with different parameters on the Raw data which is Unbalanced.</li>
<li> To improve the performance of these models Over Sampling is done to make the data balanced by creating the Synthetic data using SMOTE. </li>
<li> Then again Classification models are built on the balanced data.</li>
<li> Best Classification model is determined by analysing in various metods such as plotting Accuracy rates, ROC curves.</li>
