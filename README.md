# Crowdsourced-Mapping-Analysis
Extensive Data Analysis is done on the Dataset by Using Supervised and Unsupervised techniques. Over Sampling is done to make the data balanced and the Classification models are built with various Algorithms, each with different parameters. Best Classification model is determined by analysing in various metods such as plotting Resubstitution and Generalization Error rates.
